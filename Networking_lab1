Computer Networking: Concepts, Advantages, Disadvantages, and Applications
1. Concept of Networking

Networking refers to the interconnection of two or more computers or devices so they can share data, resources, and services. These connections can be made using wired (cables, fiber optics) or wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) communication.

Key Networking Concepts

Nodes: Devices connected to a network (computers, printers, servers).

Transmission Media: The path through which data travels (cables, wireless signals).

Protocols: Rules governing data communication (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP).

Network Topology: Physical or logical layout of a network (star, bus, ring, mesh).

Types of Networks:

LAN (Local Area Network) – small area like an office or school.

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) – covers a city.

WAN (Wide Area Network) – covers large geographic areas (e.g., the Internet).
